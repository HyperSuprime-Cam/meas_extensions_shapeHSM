This repository contains code merged from GalSim.

GalSim's HSM code uses the Template Matrix/Vector package by Mike Jarvis
(http://code.google.com/p/tmv-cpp/).  However, we don't want to add an
additional dependency, and so we have added a dummy TMV.h file that
implements the required TMV functionality (tmv::Vector, tmv::Matrix,
tmv::MatrixView, tmv::ConstMatrixView) using ndarray and Eigen.  Changes
to the TMV APIs used by HSM will need to be reflected in this TMV.h file.


We should be able to merge future GalSim updates using the following procedure:

Clone the GalSim repo:

git clone git@github.com:GalSim-developers/GalSim.git
cd GalSim

Filtered the repo to remove files we don't want:

git filter-branch \
    --prune-empty \
    --index-filter '
        git ls-tree -z -r --name-only --full-tree $GIT_COMMIT \
        | grep -z -v "^include/galsim/Std.h$" \
        | grep -z -v "^include/galsim/Image.h$" \
        | grep -z -v "^include/galsim/ImageArith.h$" \
        | grep -z -v "^include/galsim/CppShear.h$" \
        | grep -z -v "^include/galsim/Bounds.h$" \
        | grep -z -v "^include/galsim/Angle.h$" \
        | grep -z -v "^include/galsim/hsm/PSFCorr.h$" \
        | grep -z -v "^src/hsm/" \
        | grep -z -v "^src/Image.cpp" \
        | grep -z -v "^src/CppShear.cpp" \
        | xargs -0 git rm --cached -r
    ' \
    -- \
    --all


Merge into meas_extensions_shapeHSM:

cd /path/to/meas_extensions_shapeHSM
git fetch /path/to/GalSim
git merge FETCH_HEAD --edit

Because you may pull in lots of commits (the "git filter-branch" command
doesn't remove empty merge commits), please be sure to give the merge
commit a full and helpful commit message.
